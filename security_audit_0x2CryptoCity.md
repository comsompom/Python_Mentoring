Based on the analysis of the repository name and the lack of any legitimate digital 
footprint for the user `0x2CryptoCity`, **this repository is highly likely to be malicious.**

You should **NOT** download, install, or run any files from this repository.

Here is the detailed safety check and why this specific repository matches the pattern 
of a "Crypto Stealer" or "Drainer":

### 1. The "Ghost" Profile (Red Flag)
I performed a search for the user `0x2CryptoCity` and the project name, and there is **zero history** for them.
*   **Legitimate projects** have a website, a Twitter/X account, a Discord server, and community discussions.
*   **Malicious repos** are often created by fresh, anonymous GitHub accounts to host malware for a few days before being banned.

### 2. Common "Metaverse/Game" Scam Pattern
Attackers often use names like "CCity," "Metaverse," or "NFT Platform" to trick users. The typical attack vector in these repositories works like this:
*   **The Trap:** The README claims to be a "beta test" or a "play-to-earn" game client.
*   **The Payload:** It asks you to download a `.zip` file (often password-protected with "1234" or similar to bypass antivirus scanning) or run a seemingly innocent setup script.
*   **The Malware:** Inside is not a game, but a **"Stealer"** (like RedLine, Raccoon, or a Python-based drainer).
*   **The Damage:** Once run, it silently steals:
    *   Crypto Wallets (MetaMask, Phantom, Exodus).
    *   Browser Cookies (to hijack your Email, Discord, and Twitter).
    *   Saved Passwords.

### 3. How to verify it yourself (Safely)
**Do not run the code.** If you view the files on GitHub *without downloading them*, look for these malicious signs:
*   **Encrypted Zips:** Does the README tell you to unzip a file using a password? (e.g., `pass: 2023`). **This is 100% confirmed malware.**
*   **Obfuscated Code:** Look at the `.js` or `.py` files. Do they look like readable code, or are they giant blocks of random letters and numbers (e.g., `var _0x5a2d...`)?
*   **Suspicious Imports:** If it's a Python script, does it import `base64`, `subprocess`, or `os` and try to execute encoded strings?
*   **Discord Webhooks:** Malicious scripts often contain a Discord URL (starts with `discord.com/api/webhooks...`) used to send your passwords back to the hacker.

*   

### Recommendation
**Delete the repository link and do not interact with it.**
*   If you have already downloaded and run it, you must assume your PC is compromised.
*   **Immediate Steps if ran:** Disconnect from the internet, format your PC (factory reset), and—from a *different* device—change all your passwords and move funds from any crypto wallets that were on that machine.
