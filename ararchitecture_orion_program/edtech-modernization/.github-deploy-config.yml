# GitHub Deployment Configuration
# This file controls which cloud providers are automatically deployed
# when changes are pushed to the main branch

# Set to true to enable automatic deployment for each cloud provider
deploy:
  azure: false  # Set to true to auto-deploy to Azure on main branch push
  aws: false    # Set to true to auto-deploy to AWS on main branch push
  gcp: false    # Set to true to auto-deploy to GCP on main branch push

# Default environment for automatic deployments
default_environment: "prod"

# Note: Manual workflow dispatch always allows selection of any provider
# This config only affects automatic deployments on push to main
