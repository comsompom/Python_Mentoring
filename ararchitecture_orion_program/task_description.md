## Case Study 5: EdTech Startup Accelerates Personalized Learning ##

### About Customer: ###

A fast-growing EdTech startup catering to over 5 million students globally.
They faced major challenges in scaling their backend during peak periods
(exams, test result releases) and delivering personalized learning content in
near real-time.


**Customer Requirement:**

• Re-architect monolithic backend into modular microservices (Course,
Grading, Recommendations, Auth).
• Ensure elastic scaling during high-traffic periods such as exams or live
sessions.
• Support multi-tenancy for school/college-level isolation and role-based
access.

 
**Additional Comments:**

• End-to-end modernization on Microsoft Azure.
• Seamless support for mobile, web, and tablet platforms.
• Integration of adaptive learning and feedback systems for continuous
improvement.


**GenAI Assistance:**

• Auto-generated architecture documentation and deployment
diagrams for stakeholder walkthroughs and version tracking.
• Analyzed telemetry and SLA logs to identify performance bottlenecks,
aiding in service boundary redefinition.
• Validated the system design for multi-tenancy and identity
segregation strategies using generative reasoning.

**Expected Output:**

• CQRS pattern for efficient grading and submission updates.
• Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) implementation tailored for roles
(students, teachers, admins).
• Azure AKS for stateful grading workflows, Azure Functions for
stateless recommendation logic.
• Data tier includes Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Cache for Redis, and Azure
API Management for API governance.

**Future Vision:**

Use GenAI to help instructors and content teams:
• Auto-generate content tags and difficulty levels.
• Prioritize improvements based on heatmaps, feedback trends, and
usage analytics.
• Simulate curriculum changes for impact assessment on student
progress.

**Deliverables:**

The deliverable document should include the below sections but NOT
limited only to them.
Executive Summary, Current Challenges, Goals & Success Criteria, Domain
Model / Service Map, DevOps Strategy, Observability Plan, Future
Enhancements, Appendix / Any other supporting artifacts, and so on.
