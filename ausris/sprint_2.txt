Sprint 2
Task 10

0. Solve two simple problems on the Leetcode and commit to git
1. Make investigation between MongoDB, SQlite DB and AWS Dynamo DB (do not code or create any thing) - just understand which
   DB will fit to the previous FastAPI more. Investigation describe in the same FastAPI Folder in the file "DB_investigation.md".
   Create the Confluence pages;
   a. with description of the project
   b. DB investigation
   c. extend the project Readme with the links to the confluence
2. Cover all previous FastAPI project with tests. Tests should cover not just lines of the code but the logic also. All requests as the 
   DB operation should be Mocked with fake results for test but cover the logic. Tests should not be copied to the Docker container 
   in the process of the Docker container creating.
3. Check the SonarCloud and create the free account. Add the project to the sonarcloud and check the project with sonar for 
   finding potential bugs. Extend the readme with sonar links
4. Create video presentation of the done job (Show tests coverage, sonar, confluence pages, docker build, start, start localy)
