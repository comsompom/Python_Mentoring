Task 38

0. Solve two simple problems on the leetcode and commit them to repo
1. Check the materials about class functions help, dir, issubclass, len
   https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/help
   https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/issubclass

2. Check the course Regular expressions:
   https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-regular-expressions-15586553/write-text-matching-patterns?u=89254810
3. Create on the Git separate repo "regular_expressions".
   on this repo create the FastAPI app which:
   a. get the URL and search string from the user in the json format,
   b. using selenium grab the text
   c. save the text to the file, delete all none Unicode symbols
   d. using the regular expressions search the user search string and send to the user the response with found information. If requested 
      info is not found then Own Exception should be generated. Own exception should be done in own exception class. Exception should
      return to the user the error code (depends of the exception) and the explanation
4. All code should be covered with unit tests, which should be executed automatically on the Git CI/CD on  the each commit.
